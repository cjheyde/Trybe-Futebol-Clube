# Trybe Futebol Cube (Soccer Club) ⚽

This Project shows a leaderboard of all soccer teams in a competition, and lets you add teams, matches, and scores.

Here I had to exercise: POO, TDD, Node.js, Express, Typescript, Sequelize, mySQL, docker.

This is a fullstack JavaScript Project, but the frontend came already coded by the school [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).

# Trybe Futebol Cube (Soccer Club) ⚽

This Project shows a leaderboard of all soccer teams in a competition, and lets you add teams, matches, and scores.

<strong>First commit:</strong> on Sep 27, 2022.

<strong>Here I had to exercise:</strong> POO, TDD, Node.js, Express, Typescript, Sequelize, mySQL, docker.

This is a full-stack JavaScript Project, but the front-end came already coded by the school [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).
